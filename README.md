# astro-generic-build-filenames

This is an [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that modifies the filenames of build assets to more generic names.  
This package is designed to eliminate confusion caused by the default naming convention, which names files after their entry points.

To see how to get started, check out the [package README](./package/README.md)
